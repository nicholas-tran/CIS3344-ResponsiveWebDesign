            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>
                The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery.
                It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination.
                It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.
                Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers’ action.
                Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task.
                Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.
                In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).
                Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain.
                The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>The Dungeon Master (DM)</h2>
            <p>
                One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee.
                The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore.
                The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do.
                Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way?
                Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ actions and narrates what they experience.
                Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>
                The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign.
                Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off.
                The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities.
                This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.
                There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood.
                Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils.
                Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain.
                Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on.
                The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

                <br>
                <h2>D4 (4-sided)</h2>
                <p>
                    The unloved D4, also known as the caltrap.
                    If you have stepped on a D4 with bare feet, you will never forget it.
                    Because of its large flat sides it does not roll as well as the other shapes.
                    In Dungeons & Dragons, the D4 is used where you want low variation, and an average roll of 2.5.
                    Determining damage done by small weapons is a common use.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h2>D6 (6-Sided)</h2>
                <p>
                    The standard cube shape die found in most boardgames is also used in D&D.
                    Many gamers gather a set of D6 for quickly rolling multiples,
                    like the original 3D6 rolls for attributes during character creation,
                    which later turned into 4D6 discounting the lowest roll,
                    and assigning each number where the player wants.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h2>D8 - (8-sided)</h2>
                <p>
                    The eight sided die, each face is triangular and it resembles two pyramids attached base-to-base.
                    Often used for damage done by larger weapons.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h2>D10 - (10-sided)</h2>
                <p>
                    The ten sided die is used often while playing D&D.
                    There are actually two ten sided dice in a standard 7-dice D&D set.
                    The faces of one are numbered 0 to 9, and the faces of the other go from 00 to 90  by tens.
                    To make a 'percentile' roll, you roll both die and add them together, with one exception: a double zero roll is 100.
                </p>

                </div>
                <h2>D12 - (12-sided)</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the best looking of the bunch, the faces are pentagons.
                    Not as commonly used in D&D except for some damage rolls.
                    Can be used to determine the hour of day or night, or month of year.

                </div>
                <h2>D20 - (20-sided)</h2>
                <p>
                    The signature die of Dungeons & Dragons, and taller than its siblings, the D20 rolls further because it is the most spherical.
                    The faces are equilateral triangles.
                    The D20 is used any time you want to know if an attempt is successful: attacks, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
                    Each value has a 5% chance.
                    After you roll a D20 to see if you hit an enemy, you will roll other dice to see how much damage you deal.
                    Small weapons use a D4, larger weapons deal D6 or D8 damage, and the biggest deal D10 or D12.

                <p>
                    Is also used in RPGs like D & D as well. The above are basically the dice for Dungeons and Dragons that you'll need to get started. Of course as you read through your hand-book and other game resources you'll learn how each dice is used throughout the game.

                <br />
                <h2>Creating a Character</h2>
                <p>
                    Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own.
                    Your character is a combination of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard).
                    You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
                    Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world.
                    Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard.
                    Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar.
                    Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table?
                    Consider the fighter class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in any Dungeons & Dragons book to see what catches your interest.
                    Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want.
                    Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What’s important is that you come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
                    Throughout this section, we use the term character sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper.
                    An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.

                    <h2>Choosing a Race</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world.
                        The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.
                        Some races also have subraces, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf.
                        The Races section provides more information about these races.
                        The race you choose contributes to your character’s identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry.
                        Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells.
                        These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards.
                        Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too.
                        Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.
                        Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores.
                        Note these increases and remember to apply them later.
                        Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet.
                        Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Choosing a Class</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every adventurer is a member of a class.
                        Class broadly describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.
                        The character classes are described in the Classes section.
                        Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class.
                        Many of these benefits are class features — capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes.
                        You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools.
                        Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.
                        On your character sheet, record all the features that your class gives you at 1st level.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Managing Profiencies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
                        Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.
                        The six abilities and their use in the game are described in the Using Ability Scores section.
                        The Ability Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.
                        You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six numbers.
                        If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
                        Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
                        Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
                        After assigning your ability scores, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table.
                        To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the result by 2 (round down).
                        Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

                <p>
                    If meeting in a stranger’s house makes you uncomfortable, start by looking at the weekly D&D nights hosted by game stores that are part of the official D&D Adventurers League.
                    Games are played in sessions for different levels of experience at participating game stores.
                    All you have to do is get in touch with the store staff to sign up and find out more, but they can usually fit you in at any time in the campaign.
                    If you’re new to D&D, simply begin by creating your own character.
                    You don’t even need to buy the Player’s Handbook: Wizards of the Coast provides online resources for making and printing your first character sheet.

                <p>
                    Use a basic search on Facebook for Dungeons & Dragons groups to start looking for your next adventure.
                    You can also search for “dungeons & dragons [city]” and click Groups to see if there’s a local gathering nearby.
                    And of course, if you’re feeling particularly brave, you can also create a group of your own to get the party started yourself.

                    Not only can you find board gaming groups on Meetup.com, you can also search for D&D players that congregate nearby.
                    You may have to expand the search to over 5 miles beyond your city or town, but groups motivated to invite more members will have their info ready and waiting for you.
